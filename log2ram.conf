# Configuration file for Log2Ram (https://github.com/azlux/log2ram) under MIT license.
# This configuration file is read by the log2ram service

# Specify the amount of RAM reserved for storing logs. This setting determines the maximum size of the RAM folder.
# Ensure 'SIZE=' is set larger than the current size of your /var/log directory to prevent startup failures.
# Also, configure logrotate to manage log growth and prevent the /var/log directory from exceeding this reserved size.
# The default setting of 128M suffices for many typical applications, but you may need to increase it for 
# servers or systems that generate extensive logging.
SIZE=128M

# Select the log syncing method between disk and RAM:
# - 'rsync' is the default unless 'USE_RSYNC' is set to 'false'.
# - If 'rsync' is unavailable, 'cp' is automatically used as a fallback.
# - Set 'USE_RSYNC' to 'false' to explicitly use 'cp'.
#USE_RSYNC=false

# By default, if there is insufficient RAM space, a system notification email is sent.
# Set this to 'false' to disable email notifications. (The error will still be logged locally).
#NOTIFICATION=true

# Specify the command for sending error notifications.
# By default, it uses the `mail` command to send an email, with the message body provided via stdin.
# You can replace this with any command (such as 'shoutrrr') or a custom script for handling notifications.
#NOTIFICATION_COMMAND=mail -s "Log2Ram Error on $HOSTNAME"

# Specify the directories to be stored in RAM. List each directory using its absolute path, e.g., `/path/folder`.
# Corresponding directories on the HDD, named `/path/hdd.folder`, will be automatically created for each listed path.
# Separate multiple paths with a semicolon `;` and do not include a trailing slash at the end of the paths.
# Example: PATH_DISK="/var/log;/home/test/FolderInRam"
PATH_DISK="/var/log"

# Set to 'true' to enable log rotation for journald logs before syncing. 
# Note: 'rsync' must be used for this feature to work. 
# Ensure 'SystemMaxUse' is configured in '/etc/systemd/journald.conf' (to limit journaldâ€™s disk usage)
# Note: Its value must be smaller than log2ram's RAM allocation defined by the SIZE variable above.
JOURNALD_AWARE=true
